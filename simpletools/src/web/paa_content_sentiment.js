  <h4><b>What is sentiment analysis?</b> </h4>

 <h4><b>Interpreting sentiment analysis values?</b> </h4>
  <p>Sentiment analysis attempts to determine the overall attitude (positive or negative) expressed within the text. </p>
  <ul>
  <li> <mark>score</mark>  of the sentiment ranges between <mark>-1.0</mark> (negative) and <mark>1.0</mark> (positive) and corresponds to the overall emotional leaning of the text.</li>
  <li> <mark>magnitude</mark> indicates the overall strength of emotion (both positive and negative) within the given text, between <mark>0.0</mark> and <mark>+inf</mark>. Unlike score, magnitude is not normalized; each expression of emotion within the text (both positive and negative) contributes to the text's magnitude (so longer text blocks may have greater magnitudes).</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  A question with a neutral score (around  <mark>0.0 </mark>) may indicate a low-emotion question, or may indicate mixed emotions, with both high positive and negative values which cancel each out. Generally, you can use magnitude values to disambiguate these cases, as truly neutral questions will have a low magnitude value, while mixed documents will have higher magnitude values.
