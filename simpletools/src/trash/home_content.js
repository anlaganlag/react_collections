<h4> Frequently Asked Questions </h4>

  <h5><b>What is this tool for? </b></h5>
  <p> This tool can be used to get content ideas or to identify the sentiment of the questions your customers are asking.</p>

  <h5><b>What is Googleâ€™s People Also Ask?</b></h5>
<p>People Also Ask boxes are a dynamic SERP feature, containing sets of questions related to the original search query. </p>

  <h5><b>What is sentiement analysis?</b> </h5>
  <p> Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. 
      Sentiment analysis tools allow businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands or services in online feedback. For more information <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-sentiment">Click here. </a></p>


 <h5><b>Interpreting sentiment analysis values?</b> </h5>
  <p>Sentiment analysis attempts to determine the overall attitude (positive or negative) expressed within the text. </p>
  <ul>
  <li> <mark>score</mark>  of the sentiment ranges between <mark>-1.0</mark> (negative) and <mark>1.0</mark> (positive) and corresponds to the overall emotional leaning of the text.</li>
  <li> <mark>magnitude</mark> indicates the overall strength of emotion (both positive and negative) within the given text, between <mark>0.0</mark> and <mark>+inf</mark>. Unlike score, magnitude is not normalized; each expression of emotion within the text (both positive and negative) contributes to the text's magnitude (so longer text blocks may have greater magnitudes).</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  A question with a neutral score (around  <mark>0.0 </mark>) may indicate a low-emotion question, or may indicate mixed emotions, with both high positive and negative values which cancel each out. Generally, you can use magnitude values to disambiguate these cases, as truly neutral questions will have a low magnitude value, while mixed documents will have higher magnitude values.
</p>
