# Next JS App

## Styling

The styles for this app are configured with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This is a utility based approach to CSS which allows almost all of the CSS to be configured as one big JavaScript object.

[Tailwind also features PurgeCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size#purge-css-options) which will purge out any unused CSS from the production build. This allows developers to have access to a vast collection of utility classes in development that will be removed if unused in production.
