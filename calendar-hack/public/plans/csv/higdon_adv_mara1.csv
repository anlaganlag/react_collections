# description: Hal Higdon: Advanced 1: "This training program for Advanced 1 marathoners offers a progressive buildup--similar to that for the novice and intermediate runners, except you start at 10 miles and peak with three 20-milers. There is also more training at marathon pace (usually Saturdays, the day before Sunday long runs). The major difference, however, is the addition of speedwork. Advanced 1 has one day of speedwork; Advanced 2, two. Pick your poison." (more details at the link below)
