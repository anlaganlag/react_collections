# description: Hal Higdon: Intermediate 2: "What's the difference between the Intermediate 1 and the Intermediate 2 Marathon Training Programs? A little bit of mileage, that's all. Runners who choose the latter run three 20-milers toward the end of the program instead of two. And there's a bit more mileage leading up to those 20-milers. Otherwise, the programs are basically the same. You would choose one or the other depending on how many marathons you have run and how your training has progressed." (more details at the link below)
