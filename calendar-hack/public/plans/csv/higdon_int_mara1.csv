# description: Hal Higdon: Intermediate 1: "Hal's Intermediate 1 Marathon Training Program is one step up from Novice 2. It is designed for runners who may have used the novice programs to run their first marathons and who are now looking to increase their training levels and hoping to improve their Personal Records. It is not recommended for runners doing their first marathon. If that is you, check out the descriptions of the novice programs before deciding which program to purchase. Each day Hal will send you emails telling you what to run and offering training tips." (more details at the link below)
