# name: Faster Road Racing: 8K-10K Schedule 3
# description: "8K-10K Schedule 3: 30 to 42 Miles (48-67 km) per Week" from "Faster Road Racing: 5K to Half Marathon" by Pete D. Pfitzinger and Philip Latter. "This schedule is for runners who have been training 55 to 65 miles per week. If you have been running fewer than 55 miles per week, follow the base-training schedule in chapter 8 for building up to 60 miles per week before attempting this schedule. This schedule starts at 60 miles per week and gradually builds up to 76 miles with three weeks to go before your goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit and refreshed for race day."
