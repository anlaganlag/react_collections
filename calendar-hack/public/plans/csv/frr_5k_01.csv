# name: Faster Road Racing: 5K Schedule 1
# description: "5K Schedule 1: 30 to 40 Miles (48-63 km) per Week" from "Faster Road Racing: 5K to Half Marathon" by Pete D. Pfitzinger and Philip Latter. "This schedule is for runners who have been training 25 to 35 miles per week. If you have been running fewer than 25 miles per week, you should follow the training schedule for building up to 30 miles per week outlined in chapter 8 before attempting this schedule. The schedule starts at 30 miles per week and gradually builds up to 40 miles with three weeks to go before your goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit and refreshed for race day."
