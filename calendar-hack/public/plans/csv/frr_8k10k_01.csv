# name: Faster Road Racing: 8K-10K Schedule 1
# description: "8K-10K Schedule 1: 30 to 42 Miles (48-67 km) per Week" from "Faster Road Racing: 5K to Half Marathon" by Pete D. Pfitzinger and Philip Latter. "This schedule is for runners who have been training 25 to 35 miles per week. If you have been running fewer than 25 miles per week, you should follow the base-training schedule in chapter 8 for building up to 30 miles per week before attempting this schedule. The schedule starts at 30 miles per week and gradually builds up to 42 miles with three weeks to go before your goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit and refreshed for race day."
