# Styling

For styling, I love working with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I find the utility based approach to building components very convenient. One of the best advantages is that you can build components without ever having to leave the HTML. This also saves time searching through CSS files for classes when you have to change styling later.
