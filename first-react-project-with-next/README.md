# First Next App with Redux example

## About this project

I built this project mostly to showcase how I think about using state with a library like Redux. I've kept everything else clean and simple.

## Get this project up & running

```bash
git clone git@github.com:QuentinWatt/first-next-app-with-redux.git first-react-project-with-next

## Starting a next project with Redux.

This app was intially setup from the Next with Redux example app, which can be created with the yarn command below:

npx create-next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```
