# Pure React Lessons Code

This repo contains the code for all 6 modules of the [Pure React self-paced workshop](https://purereact.com).

There is "before" and "after" code here for each of the lessons, broken out into folders.

For Module 1 (Modern JS Essentials), you can open the `index.html` file in a browser or install Parcel (`npm i -g parcel`) and run the examples with `parcel index.html` (visit localhost:1234 to view the page).

The other modules are React apps (made with Create React App). To run them, install the packages with `yarn` (or `npm install`) and then run `yarn start` (or `npm start`).
